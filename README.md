# Abstract-Art-Generator
***An app that generates abstract art for you***



So project was made part of a one month jam! It was really intresting and fun to do.

Note: **This app ONLY works with 1920x1080 screen resolution** cuz I realised too late that the buttons won't show otherwise
Adding support is a very tidious process and I didn't have time until the jam ended ):
If anyone wants to add support to diffrent screen resolutions then I would be forever grateful but that is entirely optional.

## Setup
Do "pip install -r requirements.txt" on cmd in this folder and then just run the program by doing "python (program name).py"!

## Conclusion
I hope you like my project!

Ps: My code is really meassy but please don't let it bother you too much! Feedback is greatly appriciated. God, I feel so naked like this...
