# Abstract-Art-Generator
***An app that generates abstract art for you***



So project was made part of a one month jam! It was really intresting and fun to do.

Note: **This app ONLY works with 1920x1080 screen resolution or above** cuz I realised too late that the buttons won't show otherwise
Adding support is a very tidious process and I didn't have time until the jam ended ):
If anyone wants to add support to diffrent screen resolutions then I would be forever grateful but that is entirely optional.

## Setup
Do "pip install -r requirements.txt" on cmd in this folder and then just run the program by doing 'python "Abstract Art Generator.py"'! Remember the quotes!

## Usage and Features
You can change various generation options within the settings like the amount to gen or what diffrent shapes to gen.
You can also choose from an more adnvanced generator and a more basic one depending on your hardware.
You can also save the beutiful art to your pc if you so choose straight from within the app!
You can also read the info tab within the app for even more info.

There is also lots of other minor stuff that I did not mention here so be sure to check the project out for yourself!

## Conclusion
I hope you like my project and  thanks!

Ps: My code is really meassy but please don't let it bother you too much! Feedback is greatly appriciated. God, I feel so naked like this...
